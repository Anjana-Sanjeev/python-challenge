# python-challenge

* In this challenge, two folders have been created for PyBank and PyPoll activities.
* Each folder had separate folders for resource csv files, analysis text files and the main python scripts.

# Activity 1: PyBank

* From budget_data csv in resources folder, a main script is developed which calculates 
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period 
 * The result of the main script is printed in a separate text file in the analysis folder.
  
# Activity 2: PyPoll

* From election_data csv in resources folder, a main script is developed which calculates 
  * The total number of votes cast
  * A complete list of candidates who received votes
  * The percentage of votes each candidate won
  * The total number of votes each candidate won
  * The winner of the election based on popular vote
